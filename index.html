        <h1>Welcome</h1>

        <p> 
            Welcome to my webpage. I'm a recent graduate from the University of Maryland dual Bachelor's in Mathematics and Computer Science.
            Some of my interests include programming, data science, and statistical analysis.

            This webpage is still a work in progress, but you can expect it to fill up with more content as time passes. For now, I'd like to highlight
            my projects tab. I have a link to an analysis I performed as my final project for my CMSC320 course at UMD. I investigated sold ebay listings
            for recently released video game consoles and consumer graphics cards for patterns within the context of a data science tutorial.
