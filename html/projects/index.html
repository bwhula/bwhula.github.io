        This project examines the second hand market for video game consoles and compute GPUs using data
        scraped from ebay in the Spring of 2021. It constitutes a tutorial of the data science pipeline 
        in Python and utilizes tools such as pandas, numpy, sklearn, scipy, and proxycrawl. This project
